# Check/Test

## Checking

Run `ruff check .` or get the vscode ruff extension, the rules are defined in pyproject.toml.

## Type Checking

Run `mypy .` or get the vscode mypy extension by Microsoft, the rules are defined in pyproject.toml.

## Testing

Run `pytest`, It will get its config from pyproject.toml

Of course when you start writing your app many of the tests will break. With the comments it serves as a somewhat tutorial on using `pytest`, that being said I am not an expert.

## Workflows

The '.github' folder has both a Check and Test workflow.

To get the workflow passing badges on your repo, have a look at <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/monitoring-and-troubleshooting-workflows/adding-a-workflow-status-badge>

Or if you are not using GitHub you can check out workflow badges from your Git hosting service, or use <https://shields.io/> which pretty much covers everything.

## Test Coverage

### Locally

To get code coverage locally, the config is set in 'pyproject.toml', or run with `pytest --cov=acerestreamer --cov-report=term --cov-report=html`

```bash
python -m http.server -b 127.0.0.1 8000
```

Open the link in your browser and browse into the 'htmlcov' directory.
